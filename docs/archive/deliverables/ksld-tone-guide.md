KSLD — Tone Guide & Writing Manual

Purpose
- Keep brand voice consistent: premium, modern, human.
- Apply across site copy, brochures, social posts, and CTAs.

Voice Pillars
- Confident, not boastful
- Concise, not academic
- Human, not corporate
- Outcome-focused, not vague

Short Rules (do this)
- Use present-tense active verbs.
- Prioritize outcomes and benefits first.
- Keep headlines to 6–10 words.
- CTAs: 1–3 words, action-first (Apply, Download, Visit).
- Use numerals for stats ("423+ startups"), not words.

Don'ts
- Avoid long institutional paragraphs on landing surfaces.
- Don’t use passive voice in hero or CTAs.
- Avoid jargon without an immediate benefit.

Examples — Rewrites
- Original: "The KIIT School of Leadership (KSLd) aims to nurture future leaders by developing key qualities, skills, and knowledge to drive positive change."
  - Rewritten: "We prepare leaders who build ventures, influence policy, and create lasting impact."

- Original: "This isn't business school. This is where operators become founders..."
  - Rewritten: "Not a business school — a launchpad for operators who become founders."

Headline guidance
- Use contrast: rhetorical + benefit. 
  - Format: [Provocative line]. [Benefit line].
  - Example: "Graduate with a company, not just a degree. Live venture-building inside KIIT-TBI."

Microcopy tone rules
- Forms: short labels, supportive helper text.
  - Label: "Email"
  - Placeholder: "name@example.com"
  - Helper: "We'll only use this to contact you about applications."

SEO & Meta guidance
- Title length: 50–60 chars
- Meta description: 110–150 chars, clear CTA or benefit
- Use primary keyword once in both title and description (e.g., "MBA Innovation Entrepreneurship KSLD")

Editorial checklist (for each page)
- [ ] Hero: punchy headline + one-line subhead
- [ ] 1–2 CTAs (primary & secondary)
- [ ] Outcome-focused program bullets (max 5)
- [ ] At least one measurable stat where available
- [ ] Contact line + clear CTA in footer

Approval flow
- Draft → Stakeholder review (Dean / Admissions) → Final edit (tone + SEO) → Publish
