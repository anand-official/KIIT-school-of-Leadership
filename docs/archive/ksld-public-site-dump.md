## ⚠️ What’s Not Captured / Not Reliable in This Dump

- Many sub-pages (Programs like PACE, SRI, Case Research Centre, KITES; People pages, “Ecosystem Partners”, detailed faculty lists, etc.) either have minimal content or were not easily parseable; they are not included.
- Images, PDFs (brochures), downloadable content — not included.
- Duplication issues in curriculum listings (e.g., repeated “Crafting Consumer Value”).
- Some pages have very minimal content (e.g., Leadership Network / Ecosystem Partners page shows only navigation but not full partner listing).

---

## ✅ Suggested Uses of This Dump

- Use as a baseline content pool for a redesign — rewrite and restructure according to new brand tone and UI blueprint.
- Clean up duplication, tighten messaging, convert long paragraphs into punchy, benefit-driven copy.
- Fill missing areas (faculty, partners, testimonials, images, CTAs) as part of redesign.
- Use as content reference but do not copy verbatim — rewrite for clarity, premium tone, narrative coherence.
